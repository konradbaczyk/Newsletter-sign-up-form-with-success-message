## Overview

This is a solution to the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv). This is my ninth project which I made from the Frontend Mentor.

In this project I changed view with information about success signing up because this is JS challenge and I didn't want to waste time for fixing HTML and CSS. JS works well.
